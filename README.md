# WebSeries

This is a repository of links to public web series that I personally like. I didn't produce any of these series; I simply want to store and share them with others who might enjoy them as well. 😁🎬

### Camp Camp

- [Camp Camp - Season 1 - Season 2 - Season 3](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2vBnPCQT4WLQRL62FLUSis4AMwHzNmGl)
- [Camp Camp - Full Series](https://roosterteeth.com/series/camp-camp?season=1)

Obs. The YouTube version doesn't have season 4 included yet, nor does it have the episodes "S3:E13 - Arrival of the Torso Takers" and "S3:E14 - Culture Day". They're only available on the official Rooster Teeth website, which is free but has a lot of ads.
